					<h3>Seed Funding</h3>
					<p>Funding refers to the money required to start and run a business. It is a financial investment in a company for product development, manufacturing, expansion, sales and marketing, office spaces, and inventory. Many startups choose to not raise funding from third parties and are funded by their founders only (to prevent debts and equity dilution). However, most startups do raise funding, especially as they grow larger and scale their operations. This page shall be your virtual guide to Startup funding.&nbsp;</p>

					<h3>Angel Funding</h3>
					<p>Angel funding is a form of early-stage investment where individual investors, known as angels, provide financial support to startups in exchange for equity. These angels, often experienced entrepreneurs or business professionals, play a crucial role in helping startups scale by offering not just capital but also mentorship and expertise. The terms of angel funding may include equity exchange, convertible notes, or Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs). This funding injects vital resources into startups, enabling them to develop products, expand operations, and achieve critical milestones. Angel funding acts as a bridge between initial seed funding and more substantial investments from venture capitalists.</p>
